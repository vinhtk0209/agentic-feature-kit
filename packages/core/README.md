# Agentic Feature Kit Core

`packages/core` is the provider-neutral source of truth for deterministic workflow contracts.
Provider bundles must invoke this core; they must not copy its discovery or gate rules.

## Project Intelligence

The first public contract is Project Profile schema `1.0.0`:

```bash
npx tsx packages/core/src/project-intelligence.ts <repository-root>
```

The command is read-only and emits exactly one `@@PROJECT_PROFILE@@` JSON envelope. Exit code `0`
means the profile is ready. Exit code `1` means the profile is valid but requires input, or the
repository could not be inspected safely. Exit code `2` means CLI usage is invalid.

The JSON Schema lives at `docs/schemas/project-profile.schema.json`. Consumers must also validate
the envelope fingerprint, gate/capability consistency, and ready/issues consistency with the
runtime validator exported from `src/project-intelligence.ts`.

## Runtime choice

The implementation remains TypeScript because it inspects Node package manifests, runs inside the
kit's existing Node 20+ runtime, and completes the bounded depth-two scan without a demonstrated
performance bottleneck. Python, Rust, or Go may replace a component only after a reproducible
benchmark or missing Node capability is recorded; language novelty alone is not a migration reason.

## Stability

- Schema version: `1.0.0`
- Sentinel: `@@PROJECT_PROFILE@@`
- Traversal: depth two, ignored build/dependency segments, never follow symlinks
- License: Apache-2.0 (repository root `LICENSE`)
